## System  
The system consists of several functions and configs which turn the Virtual Arsenal into a place where you can trade items for money and vice versa. A money system is not provided as of now. Instead you have the opportunity to implement your own one, like Ravage.<br/>
To make editing this system easier I have also created a mod which will let you set the attributes of a trader directly in 3den without creating a dependency:<br/>

## Setup  
### Init
Copy the files from the master branch to your mission directory where the mission.sqm is located. The function which initializes the system is called automatically before each mission start. 

### Add trader
With `TER_fnc_addShop` you can register objects and units as traders.

### Add shop inventory
The function `TER_fnc_addShopCargo` handles the list of items which a trader sells or buys.
  
## Functions
This are the currently available functions which can be used to influence the system:<br/>

### TER_fnc_getItemValues
```
/*

	Parameter(s):
	0: OBJECT - Shop object
	1: STRING - Class name of the requested item
	2: (optional) NUMBER - Type of return: class (0), price (1), amount (2) or array of those (-1)

	amount can be either a number (negative, 0 and positive) or a boolean: true - unlimited items

	NOTE: Theoretically the amount can also be false which means that the item will be removed next time the cargo us updated. This function shouldn't be able to return it though.

## Screenshots

As you can see the prices of the items are listed right next to it in a green color. The lists are also sortable by either name, price from low to high and high to low.<br>
<br>
<img src=".github/media/screenshot2.jpg" height="500"><br>
When setting a maximum amount of items which can be added to one of the containers (uniform, vest, backpack) this maximum amount is also displayed next to the current amount. Items which are not part of the shop are set to a cost of 0.<br>
<br>

Before leaving the shop the player can see what they will buy or sell. When leaving the shop any other way than over this menu then the loadout will be reset to the one with which he entered the shop.
